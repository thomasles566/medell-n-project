This repository contains full datasets and R code related to my research on the sociophonetics of Medellín Spanish

Currently, there is only one dataset available. This dataset was used for a manuscript I wrote in 2017, which has been submitted for publication. The manuscript reports a transcription-based (i.e. auditory) sociolinguistic analysis of palatal approximant strengthening in the Spanish of Medellín, Colombia. Tokens of /j/ are coded in the dataset as either "Non" (more approximant-like) or "Ass" (more assibilated). Other variables included in this dataset are word-domain, preceding segment, following vowel, word stress, speaker sex, socioeconomic class, education level, age cohort, grapheme, and word frequency. Word frequency is included as a continuous variable in both NaturalLog and Log2 transformed values.
